## About me

Being stuck in my current career and striving for new heights, I've started studying JavaScript to become a proficient FrontEnd Developer. 

Even though I'm yet at the very beginning of my way in coding, I hope for a chance to test my skills in practice soon.

That's why I'm now looking for an internship as a Junior Dev.

I'm excited about the field of developing and would welcome the opportunity to bring my strong communication skills, creativity and commitment to your team.
